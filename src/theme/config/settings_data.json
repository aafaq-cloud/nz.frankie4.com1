Brainchild also supports research into these debilitating diseases through targeted financial grants.\n <br><br>\nBrain cancer treatment is intense. It lasts for months at a time and impacts on all members of the family. Often one parent becomes the primary carer while the other strives to maintain a wage. Regional families like Kade's fight the pain of being apart and the expense of coming together.",

This program provides much-needed funding to provide therapy, counselling, and tuition after their treatments. <br><br> For example, some children may need assistance with getting back to school, others may need physical therapy to regain use of limbs after surgery, and some children may need counselling to ease their anxiety as they learn to mix with their peers. Whatever the family needs, The Better Tomorrows program will work alongside available providers and ensure that no young person will have to cover the costs of that treatment.",

If they feel snug but not too tight, they’re just right.<\/p>\n<p><b>WIDE FIT<\/b><br> If you have bunions, a neuroma, hammer toes or simply just wide feet—you’ll love our half-length footbed. These footbeds free up maximum volume in the front of the shoe. They also feature the same super-soft arch support as our full-length footbeds. Choosing our half-length footbed keeps shoes looking sleek and slimline, while cleverly creating space for feet to breathe.<\/p>\n<p><b>NARROW FIT<\/b><br> Narrow feet? We’ve got you cosy and covered. Slip a forefoot cushion under the front of the full-length footbed, towards the front of the shoe to secure a more foot-hugging fit.<\/p>\n<p><b>WHEN TWO FEET AREN’T ALIKE<\/b><br> Create a fit that’s as unique as your feet by mix-and-matching footbeds and forefoot cushions in our Sole Saver Pack™.  Whatever the shape or condition of your feet (narrow left foot, bunion bothering you on your right?)—our pack will help assemble the perfect fit for your feet. Call, email or stop into our stores to find out more.<\/p>",
